  "task_description": "# AI Agent Development Learning Path\n\nCreate a structured, progressive learning path that takes developers from AI fundamentals to building production MCP servers with TypeScript. Includes prerequisites, learning objectives, and clear progression between modules.\n\n## Rationale\nAddresses the core pain point of 'no clear pathway for learning AI agent development with TypeScript' - the primary reason developers visit this site. A structured path differentiates us from fragmented tutorials elsewhere.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a Spanish-speaking developer new to AI, I want a clear learning path so that I know exactly what to study and in what order\n- As a developer with some AI experience, I want to identify my current level so that I can skip fundamentals and dive into advanced topics\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Learning path has 5+ modules with clear progression\n- [ ] Each module has prerequisites and learning objectives\n- [ ] Path includes hands-on projects at each level\n- [ ] Visual roadmap shows progression and estimated time\n- [ ] Users can bookmark their current position\n",
